# MFPENet
code for Multistage Foreground-perception Enhancement Network for Remote-Sensing Scene Classification
## 1. Project name and introduction
For the remote sensing scene classification task in complex background, we proposed a multistage foreground-perception enhancement network (MFPENet). The idea is to enhance the perception of foreground features so as to improve the classification accuracy.
